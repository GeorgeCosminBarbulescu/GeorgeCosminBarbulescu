- 👋 Hi, I’m @GeorgeCosminBarbulescu
- 👀 I’m interested in programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and bit of SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on JavaScript projects in order to expand my knowledge and skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: for now, please leave a message here and I will get back to you. I am new here so I still need to get used with Github, but will definitely update my contact details a bit later.
